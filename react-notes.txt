JavaScript modules : used to transfer data from one js to another
    - use import / export statements
        - import statements : to use an export data from another
            - 2 type of import statements:
                - import with curly braces: if data exported using export keyword
                - import without curly braces : if data exported using  export default keyword
        - export statements : to share data from one js file to another
            - 2 ways to export :
                - using export keyword : used to  export multiple data from a single js file
                - using export default keyword : this keyword must be at the end of that file

REACT : advanced frontend application library
-------------------------------------------------------
    Basic react:
        - React app is a collection of different library
        - it is consist of different components, which used to display contents on browser.
        - all the components are arranged in a tree structure.
            - tree structure has a root node which is by default known as "App component"
            - components are reusable.
            - components are build using Pure JavaScript, these function are capable of doing single task using arguments
                - function with no side effect.
                - returns : how to display contents on browser
        - Declarative approach
        - Virtual DOM : light-weight  memory repersation of real DOM.
        - Babel library : used to display contents into browser.
        - in JSX we have to use camel case to write JSX content.
        - JSX (JavaScript XML) : JS extention for writing HTML code in JavaScript, used to display contents in browser.
            - JSX elements : ex : const heading = <h1>head</h1>
            - Rules for using JSX:
                - every JSX elements must be inside a single tag.
                    - Parent tag can be any container tag (div, section,...) or react fragments(tag without name) (<> </>)
                - every JSX code must have a closing tag.
                    - self closing tag can be used (<startingTag/>)
                - Instead of attribute "class" use "className" in JSX
                - Instead of attribute "for" use "htmlFOR" in JSX
                - in JSX, we can directly pass js code  inside curly braces.
        
    react app creation : 
        - 2 ways to create react app:
            - CRA (using create-react-app command)
            - Vite : tool for building web application
                - installing Vite Globally : npm i -g create-vite
                - React app creation using vite :
                    npm create vite@latest reactAppname -- -- template react
    file and folder structure of react app using vite
        - package.json file : npm configuration file for the project
        - package-lock.json file : used to hold version of dependent of the project.
        - eslint.config.js file: js configuration file
        - node_modules folder: used to store dependent packages locally
            - we can generate node_modules folder with the help of command npm install / npm inside
        - Public folder: used to hold data that can be accessed by any part of the project.
        - index.html file : entry point of react app
        - src folder : logic of react app is defined here
            - main.jsx file : used to render(displaying in browser) react app in html elements with id as its "root"
                - createRoot() : create a root to display react components inside a browser DOM node.
        - css file: used to defined style for all components in react app
        - app.jsx file : used to create react root component
        - assets folder : used to hold media file used in react project
    
    Components : used to display content in browser, to create a component create a js/jsx file with filename starting capital letters
        - 2 ways to create component :
            - function / Stateless based components : use js Pure function to build components,
              function name must be similar as its filename. it must return a jsx code
            - class based components : uses class to create component. class inherit react component class,
                                       render() method is used to return JSX
        - life cycle methods of react component:
            - Mounting phase : putting jsx into DOM
                - constructor()
                - getDerivedStateFromProps()
                - render()
                - componentDidMount()
            - updateing phase : when component get updated
                - getDerivedStateFromProps()
                - getSnapShortBeforeUpdate()
                - shouldComponentUpdate() - return boolean value
                    - render() 
                - componentDidUpdate()
            - Unmounting phase : Removing component from DOM
                -
        class based component            vs                 function based component

    Data sharing between react components from Parent to child :
        - use "porps" Object
    porps : its a property of a component. its an object used to transfer data from parent to child,
            parent data can be shared via child tag attribute.
   
    conditional rendering: used based on condition rendering jsx elements in browser, using if-else, ternary operator(?:) / truthy operator
    
    List in react: use map array method. set a key attribute to duplicating jsx elements in a List

    css styling in react : 
        - inline css : use style attribute to applay style to jsx elements,style must be as js object
            - syntax :  style = {{css property}}
        - External css : define a css file and link using import. we can not css file into a variable in component file
            - import "css file path"
        - using css module file: file with extention .module.css is know as css module in this
            we have to define style in class.  to use module css we have to import.
            - import variableName  from 'moduleCss file path'

    event handling in react : syntax : event = {function call}
        - binding function without arguments : event = {functionName}
        - binding function with arguments : event = {()=> functionName(arg)}
        - binding function with arguments as event : event = {(event)=>functionName(event)}
    
    State in react : used to store data of component, when a State value change component will rerender

    Hooks in react : predefined methods in react. used to provide react component features to function based component.
                     to use a hook in a functional component, it has to be call the hook.
                    - Rules to call hooks in functional component:
                        - import react hook in component file
                        - to use hook in component call the hook in the top level of the component.
                        - hooks cannot be conditional
                    - based on react features there are different type of hooks are avaiable.
                        - build in hooks :
                            - useState(initial value):used to create state in function component, theis hook will return an array of 2 arguments.
                              first argument is a state, second argument is a function name useed to update state.
                            - useEffect(callbackfn,dependency) : used to apply side effects to a functional component. we can pass side effect as its
                              first argument as call back function, we can also pass an optional dependency argument to decide when apply side effect in component
                            - useRef(initial value) : is a react hook that lets you reference a value that's not needed for rendering.
                              initial value is optional, it returns an Object having key "current"
                        - custom hooks : create a js file  to define a specific function for a special task.
                          export the function from that file. function name must start with 'use' keyword
